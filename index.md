## About Me

I am a second-year PhD student at the [National Center for Tumor Diseases (NCT)](https://www.nct-dresden.de/en/research/departments-and-groups/translational-surgical-oncology/translational-surgical-oncology) and [School of Embedded Composite Aritificial Intelligence (SECAI)](https://secai.org/) TU Dresden, Germany under the supervision of Prof. Stefanie Speidel .

My research is focused on generating training data for biomedical applications. I am interested in synthesizing image and video datasets using generative models like GANs, VAEs and diffusion with a penchant for application-driven computer vision research.

## Research Interests

- **Image synthesis:** anatomical organ generation, shape & texture controlled synthesis 
- **Video generation:** temporal consistency, labeled data generation

## News
