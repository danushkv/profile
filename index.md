## About Me

I am a final year PhD student at the [National Center for Tumor Diseases (NCT)](https://www.nct-dresden.de/en/research/departments-and-groups/translational-surgical-oncology/translational-surgical-oncology) and [School of Embedded Composite Aritificial Intelligence (SECAI)](https://secai.org/) TU Dresden, Germany under the supervision of [Prof. Stefanie Speidel](https://www.nct-dresden.de/en/research/departments-and-groups/translational-surgical-oncology).

I'm currently working on designing generative world models for high-fidelity medical simulation. I develop large-scale synthetic data pipelines for safety-critical applications such as robotic surgery, with a focus on diffusion-based image and video generation.

Beyond pixel-level realism, my goal is to model anatomy, physics, and surgical interaction in a structured, controllable manner to build simulation environments for training both surgeons and robotic systems. By learning generative world models that capture anatomical variability and tool–tissue dynamics over time, I aim to reduce the Sim2Real gap and enable robust, clinically reliable perception and autonomous surgical agents.

## Research Interests

- **Generative World Models for Surgery:** Learning structured, controllable representations of anatomy and tool–tissue interaction for simulation and training.

- **Image & Video Synthesis:** Sim2Real translation, shape- and texture-controlled synthesis, temporally consistent video generation and action-conditioned generation.

- **Embodied AI in Surgery:** Simulation-driven training of surgical robots and computer-assisted intervention systems.
